# HashMatch: A dating app for Engineers 

A dating app for Engineers  (students and professionals). A Tinder for nerds

### How it works:
New User can register with their email. After register is successful, they will see pages containing several background information questions, as well as a short questionnaire about their personality. After they fill out all the fields and answered all the questions, they can start exploring HashMatch! Users will be able to match with other people, click to see more details about a person, as well as see who they already matched with.

This is a brief description about our project goal. We are still implementing it :)
